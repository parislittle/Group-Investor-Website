        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;While there currently are not any direct competitors with Tabbed’s
        redesigned can lid, there are
        several reusable, additive solutions in the anti-drink spiking industry like Nightcap, a scrunchie
        with a hidden cap to cover the top of a drink, leaving only a hole for the straw. While this
        solution offers a way for consumers to protect themselves, it necessitates action from the
        consumers, requiring them purchase the item and carry it around with them rather than having
        the solution already embedded into the bottle.
        <br><br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few solutions in the market that modify the can itself, but
        none of them are marketed
        to prevent drink-spiking. Some companies, like Ball Packaging Europe, Foboha GmbH, and
        Can2close, use additional plastic components, which inhibits mass-production due to recycling
        difficulties of the combined materials. Other inventions, like the Xtra lid, the Soda Seal by the
        Ukrainian inventor, Johan De Broyer, and one done by Robert Davis use excess amounts of
        aluminum that are extremely costly when mass-produced. All of these lids are marketed as
        solutions to drink-spilling and preventing bugs and other external contaminants from entering the
        drink. Very few were brought to production and those that did failed to be successful in their
        launch due to reasons described above. There are no resealable cans to prevent drink-spiking on
        the market.
        <br><br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Tabbed finds itself in a unique position as a startup in the hard-seltzer
        industry that differentiates
        itself with a drink-spiking prevention design. While the contents could be comparable to a brand
        like Truly, Tabbed's redesigned can lid that is seamlessly integrated into the product and
        positioning as a drink-spiking preventative measure provides consumers with an effortless and
        reliable way to protect their drinks from potential tampering.

        <h3>Can design optimization:</h3>
        Our unique can design and lid mechanism serve as the
        cornerstones of our product’s value proposition, so we are investing in R&D efforts that
        focus on refining and improving these features. We are conducting consumer research
        through surveys to gather feedback on the usability and effectiveness of the lid
        mechanism to reduce drink-spiking. We are also exploring different materials (i.e.
        aluminum, plastic) and manufacturing processes to optimize the design for cost and
        efficiency.</p>

        <h3> Product formulation: </h3>
        We aim to develop an alcoholic beverage that meets our target
        customers’ preferences and aligns with our brand values. We are gathering feedback to
        determine the most popular recipes and experiment with different types of flavor profiles
        and ingredients. We want to create a product that stands out in a crowded marketplace.</p>

        <h3>Safety and compliance: </h3>
        Because Tabbed is designed to address the issue of drink-spiking,
        we realize the importance of investing in R&D activities that ensure that our product
        achieves what it is designed to do. We are testing our canning solution to ensure that it
        meets all relevant safety standards and regulations.</p>

        <h3> Sustainability: </h3>
        We believe that it is vital to prioritize sustainable and eco-friendly
        products, so we are committed to investing in R&D activities that promote sustainability.
        We are exploring alternative packaging materials, optimizing our manufacturing
        processes to reduce waste and energy use, and exploring methods of using recycled or
        repurposed materials.</p>
