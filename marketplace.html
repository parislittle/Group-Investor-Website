            &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;While there currently are not any direct competitors with Tabbedâ€™s redesigned can lid, there are
several reusable, additive solutions in the anti-drink spiking industry like Nightcap, a scrunchie
with a hidden cap to cover the top of a drink, leaving only a hole for the straw. While this
solution offers a way for consumers to protect themselves, it necessitates action from the
consumers, requiring them purchase the item and carry it around with them rather than having
the solution already embedded into the bottle.
<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few solutions in the market that modify the can itself, but none of them are marketed
to prevent drink-spiking. Some companies, like Ball Packaging Europe, Foboha GmbH, and
Can2close, use additional plastic components, which inhibits mass-production due to recycling
difficulties of the combined materials. Other inventions, like the Xtra lid, the Soda Seal by the
Ukrainian inventor, Johan De Broyer, and one done by Robert Davis use excess amounts of
aluminum that are extremely costly when mass-produced. All of these lids are marketed as
solutions to drink-spilling and preventing bugs and other external contaminants from entering the
drink. Very few were brought to production and those that did failed to be successful in their
launch due to reasons described above. There are no resealable cans to prevent drink-spiking on
the market.
<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Tabbed finds itself in a unique position as a startup in the hard-seltzer industry that differentiates
itself with a drink-spiking prevention design. While the contents could be comparable to a brand
like Truly, Tabbed's redesigned can lid that is seamlessly integrated into the product and
positioning as a drink-spiking preventative measure provides consumers with an effortless and
reliable way to protect their drinks from potential tampering.
