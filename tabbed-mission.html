                    <div class="description">
                        <p>Drink spiking in colleges across America is a serious and pervasive problem that puts students' safety and well-being at risk. 
                            Each year, countless students fall victim to this disturbing practice, which often goes unreported and leaves lasting physical and emotional trauma. 
                            It is time for us to take action and create a culture of awareness, prevention, and support for all those affected by this issue.
