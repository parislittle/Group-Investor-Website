                <p class = "officialask">We are asking for <strong>$600K</strong> for the first round.</p>

                <p class = "valueprop"><strong>We intend to use these funds on...</strong></p>

                <p class = "valueprop"><strong>1.<em> Startup costs: </em></strong>As a new company, we need to invest in product development, packaging design, 
                    legal fees for filing our utility patent, and marketing expenses. Because of the complexity of our product, we predict that our costs 
                    will range from tens of thousands to hundred thousand dollars.</p>

                <p class = "valueprop"><strong>2.<em> Manufacturing and production: </em></strong>To bring Tabbed to market, we will need to invest in manufacturing 
                    and production costs, including equipment, raw materials, and labor costs. We will need to invest in a variety of capital expenditures, 
                    from canning and bottling equipment to manufacturing facilities and warehouses to support our production and distribution operations.</p>

                <p class = "valueprop"><strong>3.<em> Marketing and sales: </em></strong> In order to build brand awareness and generate sales, we will need to invest 
                    in marketing and advertising efforts. We plan on utilizing digital advertising, influencer marketing, and sponsorship events to bring about 
                    brand awareness. Other expenses in this field include hiring a marketing director, ad-spend on advertising campaigns, and sponsoring events 
                    to drive sales.</p>

                <p class = "valueprop"><strong>4.<em> Expansion and acquisitions: </em></strong> We want to use our funds to support expansion efforts. 
                    We are entering new markets or acquiring complementary businesses that can help us expand our product line and distribution network. </p>
