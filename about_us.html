<p><strong class="strong">" </strong>Our team was working on the anti-drink spiking product when the web developer on our team suggested a brilliant feature. He proposed that we add a "safe word" option to the app, where users could set a word that would alert their friends or emergency contacts if they suspected their drink had been spiked. We were all so excited about the idea, and we ended up celebrating with a virtual dance party on Zoom. It was amazing to see how much fun we could have while working on such an important project.<strong class="strong2">" </strong></p>

<p><strong class="strong">" </strong> One day during a team meeting, our product designer unveiled her latest concept for the anti-drink spiking product. It was a small, sleek device that could detect certain drugs in the user's drink and alert them with a vibration or flashing light. We were all amazed by the simplicity and elegance of the design, and we couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and excitement for what we were creating. After the meeting, we decided to treat ourselves to some delicious cupcakes to celebrate our progress.

<p><strong class="strong">" </strong> As a team, we were working on the branding for our anti-drink spiking product. One of the designers suggested the name "Guardian," which we all loved. It perfectly embodied the idea of protection and safety that we wanted to convey. We spent the afternoon designing a logo and creating a website around the "Guardian" brand, and we couldn't help but feel a sense of joy and satisfaction at the progress we were making. Later that day, we all went out for a picnic in the park to celebrate our hard work and enjoy some time together in the sunshine.<strong class="strong2">" </strong></p>
